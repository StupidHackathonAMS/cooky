# Cooky

> A terrible friend.

Cooky can't do shit. He's really just outrageously terrible at anything. But
you can't really blame him cause at least he tries, and honestly, that's
probably more than you're doing. I bet you were just browsing Twitter or
Reddit, entirely ignoring the fact that you haven't called your mom in weeks.
And when was the last time you did something for a friend, out of the good of
your heart?

I bet you're a lousy friend.

Worse than Cooky even.

Call your mom, dumbass.

- Remember your passwords.
- Create secure, reasonable passwords for you.
